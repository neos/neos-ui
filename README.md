> The next generation Neos CMS interface written in ReactJS and a ton of other fun technology.

## Versioning

This repository follows the same versioning scheme as Neos itself.
Release roadmap is [available here](https://www.neos.io/features/release-process.html)

That means:
* All bugfixes go to the lowest maintained branch
* All new features go only to master
* New minor and major releases are made in sync with Neos/Flow. Bugfix releases may be available independantly

### Currently maintained versions

* NeosCMS version 5.3: branch 5.3
* NeosCMS version 7.0: branch 7.0
* NeosCMS version 7.1: branch 7.1
* NeosCMS version 7.2: branch 7.2
* latest development happens in master

## Browser support

The new interface supports all evergreen (i.e. self-updating) browsers, including: **Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge, Opera and other webkit-based browsers**.

In order to get **IE11** to work, please switch to CKEditor 4, as CKEditor 5 doesn't support it. But doing so is highly discouraged, so where possibly encourage your editors to use modern browsers.

If you discover bugs in any of the supported browsers, please [report them](https://github.com/neos/neos-ui/issues/new)!

## Features

* Better editing experience for responsive websites.
* Faster load times for the backend.
* No reload constraint for the correct stylesheets on multi-site systems.
* Updated Font-Awesome to v5.0 (old icon names are migrated on the fly).


## Installation and usage

The new UI is [already included](https://github.com/neos/neos-base-distribution/blob/3.3/composer.json#L24) in the base Neos distribution. If you don't have it installed yet, follow these steps:

1. You need to have Neos CMS 3.3 or newer up & running.

2. Run the following command:

```
composer require neos/neos-ui
```

3. Now you are all set up and you can login to the new interface as usual via `/neos` route.

### Updating

```
composer update neos/neos-ui
```

### Installing dev-master

For trying out the new UI, we recommend you to run the regularily released beta releases.
However, if you want to stay on bleeding-edge, or want to help out developing, you'll
need the `dev-master` release. You can install the master release using:

```
composer require neos/neos-ui-compiled:dev-master neos/neos-ui:dev-master
```

#### Guideline for PR and commit messages

Please see [our guideline](https://neos.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Contribute/Documentation/BeginnersGuide.html#guideline-commit-messages)
on how to write meaningful descriptions for your contributions.

#### Doing upmerges

To do the upmerge run the following commands

```
git checkout 7.0 && git fetch && git reset --hard origin/7.0 && git merge --no-ff --no-commit origin/5.3
# review and `git commit`
git checkout 7.1 && git fetch && git reset --hard origin/7.1 && git merge --no-ff --no-commit origin/7.0
# review and `git commit`
git checkout 7.2 && git fetch && git reset --hard origin/7.2 && git merge --no-ff --no-commit origin/7.1
# review and `git commit`
git checkout master && git fetch && git reset --hard origin/master && git merge --no-ff --no-commit origin/7.2
# review and `git commit`
```

#### Development commands
| Command         | Description                    |
| --------------- | ------------------------------ |
| `make clean` | delete all node_modules in every subdirectory. |
| `make build` |  Runs the development build. |
| `make build-watch` | Watches the source files for changes and runs a build in case. |
| `make build-watch-poll` | Watches (and polls) the source files on a file share. Should preferably be used when working an a VM for example. |
| `make storybook` | Starts the storybook server on port 9001. |
| `make lint`  | Executes `make lint-js` and `make lint-editorconfig`. |
| `make lint-js`  | Runs test in all subpackages via lerna. |
| `make lint-editorconfig`  | Tests if all files respect the `.editorconfig`. |
| `make test`  | Executes the test on all source files. |
| `make test-e2e`  | Executes integration tests. |

##### Custom webpack live reload options

If you are developing inside a virtual machine and you are running the
watch command on your local system it is may be needed for you to adjust
the live reload optons.

This can be done by putting an `.webpack.livereload.local.js` inside the
repository root.

An example file would look like this:

```javascript
module.exports = {
    protocol: 'http',
    port: '123',
    hostname: 'localhost'
};
```

#### Writing unit tests
The unit tests are executed with [jest](https://facebook.github.io/jest/).
To run the unit tests, execute `make test` in your shell.

Adding unit tests is fairly simple, just create a file on the same tree level as your changed/new feature, named `[filename].spec.js` and karma will execute all tests found within the spec file, other than that, just orient yourself on the existing tests.

Use `it.only(() => {})` and `describe.only(() => {})` if you want to run a specific test and not the whole test suite.

#### Integration tests

To setup end-to-end tests locally you have got to do the same things described in [CircleCI workflow](https://github.com/neos/neos-ui/blob/master/.circleci/config.yml), namely take the [test disribution](https://github.com/neos/neos-ui/blob/master/Tests/IntegrationTests/TestDistribution/composer.json) and `composer install` in it, put the right branch into Neos.Neos.Ui folder and run webserver and mysql server with the same config as described in the test distribution's [Settings.yaml](https://github.com/neos/neos-ui/blob/master/Tests/IntegrationTests/TestDistribution/Configuration/Settings.yaml) (or adjust it).

For executing the end to end tests on a Mac with catalina or higher you need to permit screen recording. Open 'System Preferences > Security & Privacy > Privacy > Screen Recording' and check 'TestCafe Browser Tools' in the application list.

##### Debugging integration tests

* View the recording via Sauce Labs. You can find the url in the beginning of the test output.
* Observe Flow exceptions and logs in build artifacts.
* You can trigger a SSH enabled build via the CircleCI interface and then login.

###### Just the end to end tests fail

It can happen that end to end tests fail caused by cached sources. So if you change PHP code for instance and don't adjust the composer.json it can happen that your new code change is not used because it is not part of the cache. In this case we need to flush the CircleCI caches manualy.

We have introduced an environment variable called CACHE_VERSION. We need to change the variable to to new timestamp for instance to invalidate the caches.

1. go to https://app.circleci.com/settings/project/github/neos/neos-ui and login
2. open the project settings and choose `Environment Variables`
3. Delete the `CACHE_VERSION` and create a new one with the value of the current timestamp

Retrigger the build and it should work.

#### Releasing

You only need to trigger the jenkins release with the version you want to release.
After jenkins has finished you need release a new version on github.
